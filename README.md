# Unicode Menu Key AHK
AutoHotkey script that allows you to enter unicode with the menu key and 
top row numbers

This is done to allow users to enter unicode without the use of a 
numberpad (useful in the cases of TKL and such keyboard).  
Besides that, the menu key loses its normal function of opening the 
context menu and now functions as a third, slightly more powerful, alt 
button.

To have the script run on startup, add the exe or script file (requires 
AutoHotkey to be installed) to "%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start 
Menu\Programs\Startup" or create a startup task with Task Scheduler
