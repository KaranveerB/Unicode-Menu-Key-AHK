# Unicode Secondary Alt AHK
AutoHotkey script that allows you to enter unicode with right alt key and 
top row numbers

This is done to allow users to enter unicode without the use of a 
numberpad (useful in the cases of TKL and such keyboard).  
Use this fork if you do not wish to lose the menu key or the thought
of having 3 alt keys bothers you to no end. Note that this will make
it so hotkeys using the right alt key with number keys will not work.

To have the script run on startup, add the exe or script file (requires 
AutoHotkey to be installed) to "%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start 
Menu\Programs\Startup" or create a startup task with Task Scheduler
